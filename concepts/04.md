- semantic action: the code that is executed when a rule is matched

```bison
expr: expr '+' expr   { $$ = $1 + $3; } ;
```

- `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, ...: the semantic values of the symbols in the rule
    - here `$1` is the semantic value of the first `expr`
    - `$3` is the semantic value of the second `expr`
> why not `$2`? because the second `expr` is the third symbol in the rule
- `$$`: the semantic value of the rule
