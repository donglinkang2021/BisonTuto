# 08 Stages in Using Bison

1. specify the grammar in a form recognized by Bison
    - each rules has action in `C` code
2. write a lexical analyzer 
    - be written by hand in C
    - to process input and pass tokens to the parser.
3. write a function to call parser
4. write error-reporting routines

source code to runnable program steps

1. write a Bison grammar file
2. produce a parser implementation file
3. compile the parser file and other source files
4. link the object files to produce an executable program
