# 05 Writing GLR Parsers

> happy to see what we have learned so far in the course

- reduce/reduce conflicts
    - two possible reductions (applications of a grammar rule) applies
- shift/reduce conflicts
    - whether to apply a reduction or 
    - read more of the input and apply a reduction later

- GLR
    - effectively cloning the parser to follow both possibilities
    - merge and split the parsers as needed
