# 09 The Overall Layout of a Bison Grammar

general form of a Bison grammar file

```bison
%{
Prologue
%}

Bison declarations

%%
Grammar rules
%%
Epilogue
```

- `%%`, `%{`, `%}` are separators
- `Prologue` define types and variables used in actions
    - use `#include`
    - need to define `yylex` and `yyerror` functions here
- `Bison declarations` declare the names of the terminal and nonterminal symbols
    - operator precedence (order)
    - the data types of semantic values
- `Grammar rules` define the grammar
    - how to construct each nonterminal symbol from its parts
- `Epilogue` contain any code you want to use
    - the definitions of functions declared in the prologue
    - In a simple program, all the rest of the program can go here
